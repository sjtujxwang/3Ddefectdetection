BINARY COMPATIBILITY
=========================
Applications built with earlier versions of pylon are incompatible with pylon 5.2.0.


NEW FEATURES / CHANGES
=========================
* pylon Viewer: [85311] Added the Sharpness Indicator feature which makes focusing
  of lenses easier.
* pylon Viewer: [70176] Added the Action Commands feature to facilitate the evaluation
  and integration of GigE Action Commands and Scheduled Action Commands.
* pylon Viewer: [68123] Added the Vignetting Correction feature which can remove
  vignetting artifacts (loss of brightness at the edges of images).
  The Vignetting Correction feature is available on selected ace L and ace U camera
  models only.
* pylon Viewer: [100601] Added an SDK samples manual.
* pylon Viewer: [100548] Updated the automatic image adjustment icon.
* CamEmu: [102456] CamEmu now also supports BayerGR8, BayerRG8, BayerGB8, and
  BayerBG8 pixel formats.
* SDK: [100038] Added CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera class, including support classes.
  This Universal Instant camera class provides users with a native parameter API
  that can be used for any interface.
* SDK: [100038] Added new samples showing the use of CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera
  and changed existing samples to show the use of parameter classes.
* SDK: [100038] Extended the C++ Programmer's Guide to include CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera
  and parameter classes.
* SDK: [100038] Added parameter classes for simplifying access to GenApi parameters,
  e.g., CIntegerParameter.
  These can be used instead of GenApi::CXYZPtr classes.
* SDK: [100038] Changed the existing configuration classes, e.g., CAcquireContinuousConfiguration,
  to use new parameter classes.
* SDK: [100038] Access methods and keys of transport layer-specific device info
  classes have been merged into CDeviceInfo.
* SDK: [102881] The image format converter now also supports the PixelType_YCbCr422_8_YY_CbCr_Semiplanar
  and PixelType_YCbCr420_8_YY_CbCr_Semiplanar input formats.
* General: All start menu entries created by pylon on Linux Debian systems are
  placed together in the individual categories.


DISCONTINUATION NOTICE
=========================
Please note that the following changes are planned for the next release of pylon:
* All PixelFormatConverter header files will be removed. It is recommended to switch
  to the CImageFormatConverter class instead.
* The header files of all low-level camera classes, e.g., BaslerGigECamera.h, will
  be removed. pylon will provide a header-only replacement that can be copied to
  the code base of the program using pylon.
* All device-specific camera classes will be replaced by the Universal Instant camera
  class. The header files will stay in place and redirect to the Universal Instant
  camera class.
* All Legacy C++ samples will be removed.
* All device-specific C++ samples will be removed. These samples are replaced by
  the Universal C++ samples.
* All currently deprecated functions and classes, e.g., in PixelType.h, will be removed.


CORRECTIONS
=========================
* pylon Viewer: [97454] The maximum display rate has been limited to 25 Hz.
* pylon Viewer: [105607] Fixed issues when using the Color Calibrator tool on
  GigE cameras and cameras with auto functions enabled, e.g., ExposureAuto. In
  the second step, the image is now displayed in black and white to achieve better
  calibration results.
* pylon Viewer: [96663] Replaced parentheses and spaces in file names with an underscore
  when recording a sequence of still images.
* pylon Viewer: [89451] The default setting of the Histogram pane is now linear
  scale instead of logarithmic.

* SDK: Fixed missing entry for Mono10p pixel type in Pylon::CPixelTypeMapper class. Mono10p can
  now be displayed by the pylon Viewer.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed a problem that caused the pylon Viewer to generate additional
  CPU load in idle state.
* SDK: The SoftwareTrigger Configuration class did not work correctly with linescan cameras.
* GigE: The device enumeration mechanism may have missed cameras if a certain number of connected
  cameras was exceeded.
* USB3: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when IDeviceFactory::IsDeviceAccessible for USB 3.0 cameras
  was called.
* SDK: ITransportLayer::ReleaseTl() did not always free the resources allocated by a transport layer.
  This fix may affect applications accidentally calling ReleaseTl() too often. Ensure
  that for every call of CTlFactory::CreateTl() there is only one ReleaseTl() call.
* SDK: Fixed thread-safety issues with the CTlFactory class.
* pylon Viewer: No camera features were shown if a device could only be opened at second attempt.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed problems occurring when enabling the Line Pitch camera feature.
* pylon Viewer: The "Copy Camera Features" menu entry only became available after the first image had
  been grabbed.
* USB3: Exception may have been thrown when closing the camera.
* USB3: Fixed problems occurring when enabling the Line Pitch camera feature.
* USB3: Statistics: Incomplete frames were counted as 'missed frames'.
* GigE: Fixed resource leak that occurred when using action commands.
* USB3: Fixed a bug in the device enumeration which may have caused an incomplete USB 3.0 device list.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue which might cause the pylon Viewer to block in case of transmission
  errors caused by the usage of inappropriate USB cables.
* GigE Vision: Fixed a bug which prevents devices to be enumerated when the PC is not connected to a network.
* SDK: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when device-specific event handlers were registered.
* SDK: Fixed a potential crash in the pylon Image Window.
* SDK: Improved Instant Camera chunk data support. Instant Camera objects now can deal with an image
  stream consisting of both, frames with and frames without chunk data.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue which may have caused the viewer to hang or crash when removing a USB camera.
* USB3: Fixed an issue that could cause a deadlock when removing a USB camera.
* IP Configurator: The IP Configurator now refuses IP addresses from the reserved address range 0.0.0.0/8.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue where the parameters of the pixel format converter could be modified without having an effect.
* pylon Viewer: The viewer now suggests appropriate directories for saving feature settings and images.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed a bug causing the viewer to terminate prematurely.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed a bug that might have led to an endless sequence of error message boxes.
* USB3: Fixed off-by-one error in stream grabber statistics.
* SDK: Fixed spelling in pixel type mapper strings.
* SDK: Added missing chunk image sample for USB 3.
* SDK: Fixed incompatibility with some UVC devices.
* SDK: Fixed assertion which occurred on long running GigE grabs.
* SDK: Fixed an issue where enumerating/opening cameras failed if a lot of devices are
  connected to the USB bus.
* SDK: Fixed issue where pylon would not shut down without killing the application.
* SDK: Fixed issue where pylon crashes on machines without USB controller.


RESTRICTIONS
============
